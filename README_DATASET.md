Overview:

The code will be pre-process the voice dataset by extracting Mel-Frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which represent the essential features of audio signals. 
These MFCCs are then saved in a JSON file, providing a structured way to store the important acoustic for machine learning models
